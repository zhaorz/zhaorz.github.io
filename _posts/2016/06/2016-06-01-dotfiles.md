Machines will come and go---bring your configuration with you.

<!--excerpt-->

## Purpose

A variety of configurations are specified using `.`-prefixed files that live in
your home directory. You've likely spent more hours than you'd like to admit
meticulously honing them. Using a remote git repo to keep track of them serves
a few purposes--(1) keep a backup in case of hardware failure, (2) make it easy
to bring your configuration to multiple machines, and (3) let the rest of the
community see them.

## Method

The method is quite simple: keep the files you care about in a repository in
your home directory and create symbolic links to them from the home directory. I
prefer to keep my configuration in a directory named `.dotfiles` which contains
a git repo.

When you get to a new computer, just run the `install.sh` script to create
the symbolic links. The script was inspired by
[this](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and is fairly lightweight. The
important thing to note is to put any files you don't want symlinked (such as
`.git`) in the `IGNORE` array at the top of the script.

I've kept the script as simple as possible---mainly so I can come back to it in
a few months and still understand what it does. Many others have much more
involved setups. Check out [this site](https://dotfiles.github.io/) for some
amazing examples.

My full configuration can be found on
[my Github](https://github.com/zhaorz/.dotfiles).
