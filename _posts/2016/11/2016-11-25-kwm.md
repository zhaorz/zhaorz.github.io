macOS's default window manager leaves much to be
desired. [`kwm`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm) is a highly configurable
tiling window manager. This is a beginner's guide to installing and configuring
`kwm` and `khd`, which provides a keybinding interface.

<!--excerpt-->

## Architecture

`kwm` runs a daemon (i.e. background process) that detects windows and performs
actions on them. Actions include things such as focusing, moving, resizing, and
swapping. Since it is continuously running, `kwm` maintains an internal
representation of your window positioning based off a set of rules.

This differs from other styles of window management, in that if you manually
modify a window (e.g. by dragging a corner or side), `kwm` will resist your
change and resize it to what it thinks is its correct position. In most cases,
`kwm` will tile the windows on each workspace to fill the screen.

Another thing that `kwm` does differently is keybindings. Unlike other macOS
window managers, it doesn't come with a set of keybindings. `kwm` reads from a
set of rules and tiles windows automatically. You do not have to *tell* it to
split a screen between two windows, or maximize a certain window. It just goes
ahead and does it on its own.

Once the workspace is managed, however, you would probably like to perform
actions such as moving focus, swapping windows, and switching spaces. That is
the purpose of `khd`. Like `kwm`, `khd` is also a daemon, but instead of working
with windows, it manages keybindings and communicates with `kwm`.

## Installing `kwm`

Though `kwm` used to have a more involved installation process, the authors have
now provided Homebrew port which greatly simplifies the process.

~~~ sh
$ brew install koekeishiya/kwm/kwm
~~~

Note that `kwm` requires 'Displays have separate spaces' enabled.

To activate the daemon, and have it run automatically at login,

~~~ sh
$ brew services start kwm
~~~

Note that `sudo` should not be necessary. After `kwm` starts up, your workspace
should be tiled automatically. A restart may be necessary in some cases.

## `kwm` configuration

To get started, copy the example configuration into your home directory. You can
see where the example file is located by running `brew info kwm`.

~~~ sh
$ brew info kwm

...

Copy the example config from /usr/local/Cellar/kwm/4.0.2/kwmrc into your home directory.
  mkdir -p ~/.kwm
  cp /usr/local/Cellar/kwm/4.0.2/kwmrc ~/.kwm/kwmrc
~~~

Open the `kwmrc` file and take a look. Each configuration begins with the `kwmc`
prefix followed by a number of arguments. A detailed description of every
possible option can be found on
the [wiki](https://koekeishiya.github.io/kwm/kwmc.html).

I've found that the defaults are generally pretty sane. Out of personal
preference, I've chosen to disable `focus-follows-mouse` and blacklisted a few
applications that I did not want to be tiled (e.g. Photoshop, Archive Utility,
Finder, and System Preferences). Additionally, I've set the default focus color
to transparent (`0x00000000`), which I'll describe soon. Note that the colors
are in `0xAARRBBGG` format.

## Adding keybindings

To add keybindings to `kwm` operations, you'll need to install and configure
`khd`.

~~~ sh
$ brew install koekeishiya/khd/khd
$ brew services start khd
~~~

Similar to `kwm`, we use `brew services` to manage the `khd` daemon. I needed
to restart until `khd` was working, but your results may vary. One way to check
if the desired processes are running is to run

~~~ sh
$ ps -ax | grep khd
45031 ??         0:01.23 /usr/local/Cellar/khd/1.1.0/bin/khd
...
~~~

If `khd` is up, you should see an executable in `/usr/local/Cellar/khd` show up.

## Introduction to modal keybindings

`khd` is a modal-hotkey daemon. Modal means that at any time, you may be in any
one of several modes, and the actions of each keybinding is dependent on the
current mode. If you use `vim`, you may already be familiar with modal
keybindings. Otherwise, the concept may be fairly new.

First, we'll lay out the general idea of what we want our keybindings to
accomplish, then we'll walk through how to implement our system in `khd`.

### Our 'modes'

We will begin with three modes: **default**, **switcher**, and **swap**.

#### default

The `default` mode is meant to be the resting state of our system. In `default`
mode, pressing keys shouldn't interfere with the applications we're using. If
you are a `vim` user, we are aiming for something akin to normal mode (no
editing capability).

`default` mode should have a single keybinding to enter a different mode with
more functionality. We'll call it `switcher`.

#### switcher

We'll use `switcher` mode to do a lot of things. First, we want to be able to
switch focus between windows. We'll also switch focus between spaces
(i.e. virtual desktops) and throw windows from one space to another. At the end,
we'll add a few extra functionalities such as opening new terminal windows.

Finally, from `switcher` mode, we will have the option to enter `swap` mode.

#### swap

In `swap` mode, we can make 'edits' to our window layout by swapping the
positions of windows and rotating the entire workspace. This is like `vim`'s
insert mode.

## Define our modes

So, inside of a file named `.khdrc`, which should be located in your home
directory, we first define our three modes, and assign them colors. The colors
will be displayed by the border around focused windows.

{% highlight conf %}
# Enable kwm compatibility mode
khd kwm on

# Set mode colors
khd mode default  color 0x00000000
khd mode switcher color 0xddbdd322
khd mode swap     color 0xdd458588
{% endhighlight %}

## Choose a prefix key

To switch from default into our other modes, we'll need a prefix. Ideally, a
prefix should be quick to type. I've remapped the <kbd>caps</kbd> key to trigger
<kbd>f19</kbd>, which I'll be using as my prefix. This can be done easily using
[Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) which is
available for macOS Sierra (<kbd>f19</kbd> is keycode `80`, or `0x50`).

## Define mode switching

Now, we'll define a way to switch between modes. There is a lot of freedom in
how to do this, so definitely use what you feel is the most natural.

Starting from `default` mode, we will switch into `switcher` mode by hitting
the prefix key (keycode `0x50` in my case).

In `switcher` mode, we will define a single press of `s` to get us to `swap`
mode.

Finally, if we are either in `swap` or `switcher`, a single press of the prefix
should take us back to `default`. To make this work, the configuration looks
like

{% highlight conf %}
- 0x50             :   khd -e "mode activate switcher"
switcher - 0x50    :   khd -e "mode activate default"
swap     - 0x50    :   khd -e "mode activate default"
switcher - s       :   khd -e "mode activate swap"
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that the syntax of a keybind is `<keysym> : <command>` where
`<keysym>` is composed of the mode name, followed by a `-`, and then a literal
(`s`), or a keycode (`0x50`).

To test out our mode configuration, we need to reload `.khdrc`. The easiest
way to do this is

~~~ sh
$ brew services restart khd
~~~

So we can walk through how this configuration captures the behavior we desire.
Assuming we start in `default` mode, a single press of <kbd>caps</kbd> (which
triggers `0x50`) brings us to `switcher` mode. If we want to leave, another
press of <kbd>caps</kbd> takes us back to `default` mode (this logic is captured
on the second line).

In `switcher` mode, pressing <kbd>s</kbd> gets us to `swap` mode (line 4). In
`swap` mode, pressing <kbd>caps</kbd> gets us back to `default` mode (line 3).

## `switcher` functionality

Now, we are ready to actually add some functional keybindings. The commands
triggered by these keybindings are all prefixed with `kwmc`, which is a program
that can interact with `kwm`, the actual window manager. You can type these
commands individually into a terminal, and observe the expected behavior.

{% highlight conf %}
# Switch focus
switcher - h             :   kwmc window -f west
switcher - l             :   kwmc window -f east
switcher - j             :   kwmc window -f south
switcher - k             :   kwmc window -f north

# Switch to space n
switcher - 1             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 1
switcher - 2             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 2
switcher - 3             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 3
switcher - 4             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 4
switcher - 5             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 5
switcher - 6             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 6
switcher - 7             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 7
switcher - 8             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 8
switcher - 9             :   kwmc space -fExperimental 9

# Throw to left/right space
switcher + shift - left  :   kwmc window -m space left;\
                             kwmc space -fExperimental left
switcher + shift - right :   kwmc window -m space right;\
                             kwmc space -fExperimental right
{% endhighlight %}

So in `switcher` mode, pressing <kbd>h</kbd> will switch focus to the left
neighbor of the current window. Pressing <kbd>3</kbd> switches to the third
space, and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>left</kbd> throws the currently focused
window left one space.

## `swap` functionality

{% highlight conf %}
# Swap windows
swap - h                :   kwmc window -s west
swap - j                :   kwmc window -s south
swap - k                :   kwmc window -s north
swap - l                :   kwmc window -s east

# Rotate
swap - r                :   kwmc tree rotate 90
{% endhighlight %}

In `swap` mode, pressing <kbd>h</kbd> swaps the currently focused window with
its neighbor to the left. Pressing <kbd>r</kbd> performs a rotation of all
windows on the workspace. The name of the command, `tree rotate` comes from the
way `kwm` represents window tilings internally--as a binary-space-paritioning
tree.

## New Finder/iTerm windows

A common action that you may want to perform is opening a new Finder or iTerm window.
First, consider the following two scripts:

{% highlight applescript %}
# ~/bin/iterm.scpt
tell application "iTerm2"
  create window with default profile
end tell
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight applescript %}
# ~/bin/finder.scpt
tell application "Finder" to make new Finder window
{% endhighlight %}

We can bind these scripts to quick keybindings in `switcher` mode using

{% highlight conf %}
switcher - return        :   osascript ~/bin/iterm.scpt
switcher - n             :   osascript ~/bin/finder.scpt
{% endhighlight %}

## Hyper key (untested)

As of the writing of this article, the typical way of using the <kbd>caps</kbd>
key to trigger <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>shift</kbd> is not yet possible
because [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en)
and [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en) are not released
for macOS Sierra.

As mentioned
before, [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) can
still be used on macOS Sierra to rebind <kbd>caps</kbd> to <kbd>f19</kbd>. Then,
the following configuration in `.khdrc` may be a possible way to trigger our
<kbd>hyper</kbd> key

{% highlight conf %}
- 0x50   :   khd -p "cmd + alt + ctrl + shift"
{% endhighlight %}

which uses `khd -p` to simulate our desired keypress. Note that **I have not yet
tested** this method, but it seems plausible.

## Wrap up

Hopefully this article was a helpful introduction to the world of macOS window
managers. Using a window manager may not be for everyone, but the ones who do
rarely look back. My full configuration of `kwm` can be found in my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/zhaorz/.dotfiles).

`kwm` is just one of many solutions, and I encourage you to find whatever system
works for you. It still has a few kinks (such as occaisional window
oscillations) but mostly feels stable. It's greatest strength, configuration,
may be its greatest weakness, especially for users who don't need or don't
want the level of customization it provides.

But for the right person, `kwm` is a refreshing blend of functionality,
configurability, power, and elegance.
