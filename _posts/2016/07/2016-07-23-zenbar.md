Zenbar is an unobtrusive status bar for your workspace. Recently, I've been
experimenting a bit with i3wm on Arch Linux, and one of the things I wanted to
replicate on macOS was its status
bar. [Clone it on Github](https://github.com/zhaorz/zenbar).

<!--excerpt-->

The stock menu bar on macOS is good for performing *actions* (such as File >
Save). Menu bars lack the idea of monitoring machine status (battery level, cpu
load, etc.).  The configuration of the stock menu bar is also limited to a
choice between a light and a dark theme.

## Ubersicht

After looking around, I decided to try out
[Ubersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/), an application that allows you to
put widgets on the desktop. Widgets are written as web components, which means
you can write your own widgets if you know a bit of HTML and CSS.

The design is quite similar to the status bars of various nix window managers.
Each widget specifies an executable command (e.g. `date`) which provides an
output string and a function that performs final formating on that
output. Various options such as refresh rate and CSS styling are also available.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a relative import system in place, so
each of the widgets are pretty much standalone. It may be possible to have some
`style.css` file and import it from all your widgets, but it's a nontrivial
configuration.

## zenbar

So, I forked the existing [nerdbar](https://github.com/herrbischoff/nerdbar.widget)
widget and make a few modifications to suit my tastes. Most of the changes were
minor aesthetic ones, as nerdbar was already pretty minimal. It does add an
extra volume widget, if you've been looking for one. Check out
[zenbar on Github](https://github.com/zhaorz/zenbar)!
